**Behold** . . .

The limbic system. The entrep√¥t for nearly all of our internal problems. Within the entangled mesh of the brain, this system mediates the most fundamental aspect of our minds: habit.

The path of least resistance. This theme is ubiquitous in our world, from the way that molecules form to the solidification of automatic behaviors in organisms. The basal ganglia is a wonderful neurological example of this concept. Take for example a rat learning how to navigate a maze to find a reward of food. When the rat is first exposed to the maze, its brain activity appears to be running at full power, and there is a significant delay in how long it takes the rat to get to the food, as it explores and deciphers the maze.

After repeated trials, the rat begins to automate its actions and run the fastest route to the food; simultaneously, the rat's brain significantly decreases its activity, relegating most of the tasks to the basal ganglia, the central location for recalling its habits.
