**Your life** will inevitably end in death. 

It is gravely important to remember this terrible, tragic fact of life, as it should kindle a fire that keeps you in motion, as opposed to static complacency. 

There are no redeeming factors in catering to our mimetic resting states and entrenching ourselves in paths that have been well-worn by many before us. The status quo is driven by a certain kind of fear, a fear characterized by the _'flight'_, as opposed to the _'fight'_ mechanism. Such a state causes one to constantly look to their immediate surroundings for help, finding the paths of least resistance to hedonically quiesce their fears. 

Those who do not entertain the immediate tendencies to capitulate in the face of fear choose to _'fight'_. One could describe this course of action as a forging of one's own path. Fighting against the grain of a potential well does indeed necessitate a work function; but such a pursuit can yield a sense of liberation akin to those described in the [allegory of the cave](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ihum40/cave.pdf "Plato - Allegory of the Cave").

If you have decided that the mind-numbing, ritualistic, surrendering behaviors that we all are prone to are not to be components in the vector that you seek to be on, then it is important to note that finding the right frameworks of thought regarding this increasingly complex world is an optimal way to reduce the errors and increase the odds of achieving collinearity with your desired vector.
