# m端v mobile app

### **m端v is a mobile application designed to allow restaurants to interface directly with their local customers.**

Local restaurants have difficulties in effectively marketing their deals, specials, and events; likewise, potential customers don't have an easy way to access this information. We aim to bridge this gap by creating a network for local restaurants to streamline this information to their customer base.

We provide cheap, technological solutions to restaurant promotion. Instead of letting restaurants spend excessive amounts on creating yet another app for their business, m端v unifies all of that information on a single platform. 

Restaurants will have the power to create their own rewards and incentives to send to their loyal customers, as well as post dynamic deals to a timeline that anyone around can see.
