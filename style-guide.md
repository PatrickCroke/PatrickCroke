# müv mobile app

### **müv is a mobile application designed to allow restaurants to interface directly with their local customers.**

Currently, there are no efficient search engines for deals and events near you. We offer a consolidated platform where users can access this relevant information, and where local restaurants can dynamically update their promotions.

## Unordered Lists

Groups a collection of items that do not have a numerical ordering, and their order in the list is meaningless.

* Donec non tortor in arcu mollis feugiat
* Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit
* Donec id eros eget quam aliquam gravida
* Vivamus convallis urna id felis
* Nulla porta tempus sapien
